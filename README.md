# Warpy 🚀🌎

a social live streaming platform **✨**

## Notes ⚠️

the project is archived until better times 🥲

Source code is published for scavenging purposes (there might be good ideas, but I'm not sure 🤣). 

## Features

- audio/video rooms with up to 4 video streamers
- easily shareable content (allows people to watch streams in the browser w/o installing the app)
- bots api (music bots, restream, etc)
- (somewhat) scalable media architecture
- WebSocket API
- UX with Reanimated 2
